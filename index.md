# From Words to Sound: Neural Audio Synthesis of Guitar Sounds with Timbral Descriptors

This website is meant to be used as a companion to the paper *From Words to Sound: Neural Audio Synthesis of Guitar Sounds with Timbral Descriptors* by The Sound of AI Open Source Research community and it contains a few examples of generated audio samples and how they were achieved.

## Examples of audio samples generated by voice and text inputs

| Voice Query                   | Audio                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Give me a bright guitar       | <audio src="audio/BRIGHT_GUITAR_40.mp3" controls></audio>    |
| Give me a blue guitar sound   | <audio src="audio/BLUE_SOUND_40.mp3" controls></audio>       |
| Rich guitar tone	            | <audio src="audio/RICH_GUITAR_TONE_40.mp3" controls></audio> |
| Give me a dark metallic sound | <audio src="audio/DARK_METALLIC_40.mp3" controls></audio>    |
| A soft acoustic sound	        | <audio src="audio/SOFT_ACOUSTIC_52.mp3" controls></audio>    |
| A noisy percussive guitar     | <audio src="audio/NOISY_PERCUSSIVE_52.mp3" controls></audio> |
| Give me a warm hollow sound   | <audio src="audio/WARM_HOLLOW_52.mp3" controls></audio>      |

## Examples of audio samples generated by tweaking the timbral descriptors and latent variables

| Meaningful Parameters Manipulated                                                          | Audio                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Very Low Attack, Very High Decay, No Low-Mid, Max Hi-Mids and High                         | <audio src="audio/EXPLORATORY_1_40.mp3" controls></audio> |
| Max Inharmonicity, Odd harmonics, Very Short Decay                                         | <audio src="audio/EXPLORATORY_2_52.mp3" controls></audio> |
| Very high Z0, Long ATK, high RMS for ATK and DEC, Even Harmonics, lots of Mids and Hi-Mids | <audio src="audio/EXPLORATORY_3_52.mp3" controls></audio> |
