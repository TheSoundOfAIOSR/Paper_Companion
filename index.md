# From Words to Sound: Neural Audio Synthesis of Guitar Sounds with Timbral Descriptors

This website is meant to be used as a companion to the paper *From Words to Sound: Neural Audio Synthesis of Guitar Sounds with Timbral Descriptors* by The Sound of AI Open Source Research community and it contains a few examples of generated audio samples and how they were achieved.

You can learn more about the collaborative, open source research effort from <a href="https://thesoundofaiosr.github.io/" title="The Sound of AI - Open Source Research" target="_blank" style="color: #0080FF; text-decoration: none;">The Sound of AI - Open Source Research</a> website, try out the sound generation tool from our <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/thesoundofaiosr/rg_sound_generation/main/app.py" title="Sound Generation Webapp" target="_blank" style="color: #0080FF; text-decoration: none;">webapp</a> or download and install the desktop app from the <a href="https://github.com/TheSoundOfAIOSR/project_common" title="main project repository" target="_blank" style="color: #0080FF; text-decoration: none;">main project repository</a>.

## Examples of audio samples generated by voice and text inputs

These examples were obtained using the end-to-end workflow of the app as described in the paper, by recording a voice prompt and generating the corresponding sound.

| Voice Query                   | Audio                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Give me a bright guitar       | <audio src="audio/BRIGHT_GUITAR_40.mp3" controls></audio>    |
| Give me a blue guitar sound   | <audio src="audio/BLUE_SOUND_40.mp3" controls></audio>       |
| Rich guitar tone	            | <audio src="audio/RICH_GUITAR_TONE_40.mp3" controls></audio> |
| Give me a dark metallic sound | <audio src="audio/DARK_METALLIC_40.mp3" controls></audio>    |
| A soft acoustic sound	        | <audio src="audio/SOFT_ACOUSTIC_52.mp3" controls></audio>    |
| A noisy percussive guitar     | <audio src="audio/NOISY_PERCUSSIVE_52.mp3" controls></audio> |
| Give me a warm hollow sound   | <audio src="audio/WARM_HOLLOW_52.mp3" controls></audio>      |

## Examples of audio samples generated by tweaking the timbral descriptors and latent variables

These examples try to showcase the sound design capabilities achievable by tweaking and exploring the sliders representing timbral characteristics and latent space parameters.

| Meaningful Parameters Manipulated                                                          | Audio                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Very Low Attack, Very High Decay, No Low-Mid, Max Hi-Mids and High                         | <audio src="audio/EXPLORATORY_1_40.mp3" controls></audio> |
| Max Inharmonicity, Odd harmonics, Very Short Decay                                         | <audio src="audio/EXPLORATORY_2_52.mp3" controls></audio> |
| Very high Z0, Long ATK, high RMS for ATK and DEC, Even Harmonics, lots of Mids and Hi-Mids | <audio src="audio/EXPLORATORY_3_52.mp3" controls></audio> |
