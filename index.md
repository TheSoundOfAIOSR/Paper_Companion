# From Words to Sound: Neural Audio Synthesis of Guitar Sounds with Timbral Descriptors

This website is meant to be used as a companion to the paper *From Words to Sound: Neural Audio Synthesis of Guitar Sounds with Timbral Descriptors* presented by <a href="https://thesoundofaiosr.github.io/" title="TSOAI OSR Website" target="_blank" style="color: #0080FF; text-decoration: none;">The Sound of AI - Open Source Research</a> group at the <a href="https://2022.aimusiccreativity.org/" title="AIMC 2022 website" target="_blank" style="color: #0080FF; text-decoration: none;">3rd Conference on AI Music Creativity 2022</a> and it contains a few examples of generated audio samples and how they were achieved.

You can try out the sound generation tool from our <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/thesoundofaiosr/rg_sound_generation/main/app.py" title="Sound Generation Webapp" target="_blank" style="color: #0080FF; text-decoration: none;">webapp</a>.

## Examples of audio samples generated by voice and text inputs

These examples were obtained using the end-to-end workflow of the app as described in the paper, by recording a voice prompt and generating the corresponding sound.

| Voice Query                   | Audio                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Give me a bright guitar       | <audio src="audio/BRIGHT_GUITAR_40.mp3" controls></audio>    |
| Give me a blue guitar sound   | <audio src="audio/BLUE_SOUND_40.mp3" controls></audio>       |
| Rich guitar tone	            | <audio src="audio/RICH_GUITAR_TONE_40.mp3" controls></audio> |
| Give me a dark metallic sound | <audio src="audio/DARK_METALLIC_40.mp3" controls></audio>    |
| A soft acoustic sound	        | <audio src="audio/SOFT_ACOUSTIC_52.mp3" controls></audio>    |
| A noisy percussive guitar     | <audio src="audio/NOISY_PERCUSSIVE_52.mp3" controls></audio> |
| Give me a warm hollow sound   | <audio src="audio/WARM_HOLLOW_52.mp3" controls></audio>      |

## Examples of audio samples generated by tweaking the timbral descriptors and latent variables

These examples try to showcase the sound design capabilities achievable by tweaking and exploring the sliders representing timbral characteristics and latent space parameters.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Very Low Attack, Very High Decay, No Low-Mid, Max Hi-Mids and High                         | <audio src="audio/EXPLORATORY_1_40.mp3" controls></audio> |
| Max Inharmonicity, Odd harmonics, Very Short Decay                                         | <audio src="audio/EXPLORATORY_2_52.mp3" controls></audio> |
| Very high Z0, Long ATK, high RMS for ATK and DEC, Even Harmonics, lots of Mids and Hi-Mids | <audio src="audio/EXPLORATORY_3_52.mp3" controls></audio> |

## Examples of audio samples generated by tweaking the latent variables

These examples showcase the sounds obtained by maniuplatin the latent space parameters and the initial sound used.
